    "about": "From Army Aviation to front-end web development, a little about me:\n\n I served in the United States Army for 7 years as an Apache Avionics, Electronics, and Armament repairer. The Apache attack helicopter is a powerful weapons platform, filled with black boxes all communicating with one another.\n\nThis was my catalyst into Computer Science.\n\nFrom the start, I knew that I would not make a career out of the military, so I made a plan. While I was stationed in South Korea, I got to choose my next duty station. I chose JBLM due to it's proximity to UW Tacoma. I knew that I wanted to exit the military and pursue a CS degree at UW Tacoma, so I did exactly that.\n\nAfter graduating in 2022, I bombed a few interviews and decided to attend a coding bootcamp to sharpen my skills. I graduated from TLG Learning's SDE course in March 2023. From April 2023 - now I have  been working full-time as a front-end developer for Sinclair Digital.\n\n"
