    From Army Aviation to front-end web development, a little about me:

    I served in the United States Army for 7 years as an Apache Avionics, Electronics, and Armament repairer.
    While the Apache is an impressive weapon platform, it is essentially many computers talking to eachother.
    
    This was my catalyst into Computer Science.
    
    From the start, I knew that I would not make a career out of the military, so I made a plan. While I was stationed in South Korea, I got to choose my next duty station.
    I chose JBLM due to it's proximity to UW Tacoma. I knew that I wanted to exit the military and pursue a CS degree at UW Tacoma, so I did exactly that.
    
    After graduating in 2022, I had a few unsuccessful interviews and decided to attend a coding bootcamp to sharpen my skills. I graduated from TLG Learning's SDE course in March 2023. From April 2023 onward, I have  been working full-time as a front-end developer for Sinclair Digital.
