    From Army Aviation to front-end web development, a little about me:

    I served in the United States Army for 7 years as an Apache Avionics, Electronics, and Armament repairer.
    While the Apache is an impressive weapon platform, it is essentially many computers talking to each other, which piqued my curiosity.
    
    This was my catalyst into Computer Science.
    
    From the start, I knew that I would not make a career out of the military, so during my 5th year of active duty, I made a plan. Because I was involuntarily stationed in South Korea for the year, I was afforded the opportunity to choose my next duty station. After researching respected universities for Computer Science, I noticed that the University of Washington was a great choice, and even better, had a Tacoma campus close to Joint Base Lewis-McCord.
    
    From September 2018 to June 2022, I worked towards my degree. After graduating, I had a few interviews that ultimately lead to dead ends. I knew that I had the soft skills required for interviewing and being a successful developer, but I knew that I needed to improve my programming skills.
    
    My friend and fellow veteran, Ryan Trepanier, recommended that I apply to TLG Learning's SDE program, a 12-week intensive course designed for veterans with no programming experience to learn enough to change careers and succeed in software development. As I had a CS degree, I was able to excel during the course, regularly in the top 10% of my 21-person cohort. Additionally, because UW-T taught Java as its OOP language, I was able to tutor fellow student-veterans during the course and solididy what I knew even more.
    
    I graduated from TLG Learning's SDE course in March 2023. From April 2023 until August of the same year, I was working as an intern full-time within their Interactive team developing React based web components. Myself and 2 other people were primarily responsible for designing an internal tool used by producers to dramatically increase their productivity. Sinclair's CDO knew that producers could struggle from writer's block when they had to produce a great headline. We created a tool that utilizes ChatGPT-4 to suggest headlines to the user instantly.
    
    From August 2023 to present day, I am working full-time as an Associate Software Development Engineer with Sinclair's News Apps team. Sinclair owns 73 local news stations across the country, each with an iOS and Android app. As a team, we have been working tirelessly to improve the user experience and drive more ad revenue for the company and have been very successful.
