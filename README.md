## Portfolio Description

Although I have a CS degree, have completed a bootcamp that included frontend Javascript, and work in front-end software development, I have never actually created a website until now.

This is a pretty basic project. I set a goal of building a website that looks decent, is dynamic, and explains who I am and how I got to where I'm at. It currently features projects from my coding bootcamp, and I'll add more projects in the future as I finish them.

Since I use React Native and Typescript for my day job, I decided to use React in this project. I also decided to initially keep it oldschool with CSS. A few commits later, I decided I wanted to incoporate some kind of CSS framework. I tried to read Tailwind CSS and absolutely hated it from a readability standpoint, although I'll admit it's quite powerful. I'll use it in a future project, but only if said project needs next to zero maintainence. I decided to simply use SASS, as it came with some cool OOP features out of the box, but still allowed me to re-learn vanilla CSS after not touching it for a few years.
